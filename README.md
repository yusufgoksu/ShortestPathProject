# Shortest Path Project

This project implements classic shortest path algorithms in Java to find optimal paths in weighted graphs. Users can input graph data, select different algorithms, and view the shortest paths and distances between nodes.

## Features

- Implementation of major shortest path algorithms (e.g., Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford)
- User-friendly input for graph nodes, edges, and weights
- Displays shortest paths and their total costs
- Clean, modular, and extensible Java codebase

## Technology Stack

- **Programming Language:** Java

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or above

### Installation & Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yusufgoksu/ShortestPathProject.git
    cd ShortestPathProject
    ```

2. **Compile the project:**
    ```bash
    javac Main.java
    ```

3. **Run the program:**
    ```bash
    java Main
    ```

4. **Follow the on-screen instructions to enter your graph data and choose an algorithm.**

## Example Usage

You can input your graph data directly in the console.  
For example, define nodes, add edges with weights, and select which algorithm to use.
